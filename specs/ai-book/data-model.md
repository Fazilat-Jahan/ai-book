# Data Model: AI-Book Hackathon Deliverables

Based on `specs/ai-book/spec.md` - Key Entities:

## 1. Course Content

**Description**: Represents the complete details of the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics program", including curriculum, weekly breakdown, hardware, assessments, glossary, and summary. This is the source material for the AI-generated textbook and the RAG chatbot's knowledge base.

**Fields**:
- `id`: Unique identifier for a content section (e.g., module, chapter, assessment).
- `title`: Title of the content section.
- `content`: The raw text content of the section.
- `metadata`: (Optional) Additional information like module number, week, type (e.g., 'intro', 'module', 'assessment', 'glossary', 'hardware').
- `source_file`: Original file path from which the content was extracted.

**Relationships**:
- `Course Content` will be processed and indexed by Qdrant for vector search.

**Validation Rules (Implicit from Spec)**:
- Content must be based solely on provided course details and hardware requirements.
- Content should be clearly formatted and easy to read (FR-001, User Story 1).

## 2. User Query

**Description**: Represents the questions or selected text submitted by a user to the RAG chatbot.

**Fields**:
- `text`: The user's question or the selected text snippet.
- `context_id`: (Optional) Identifier for the specific Docusaurus page or section from which text was selected, if using "ask-selected" feature.

**Relationships**:
- `User Query` is sent to the RAG chatbot backend.

**Validation Rules (Implicit from Spec)**:
- Queries can be based on general questions or selected text (FR-005, User Story 2).

## 3. Chatbot Response

**Description**: Represents the answer provided by the RAG chatbot, derived from the Course Content.

**Fields**:
- `answer`: The generated answer text.
- `source_references`: (Optional) List of `Course Content` IDs or URLs from which the answer was derived, to provide traceability.
- `confidence_score`: (Optional) A score indicating the chatbot's confidence in the answer.

**Relationships**:
- `Chatbot Response` is generated by the RAG chatbot backend based on `User Query` and `Course Content`.

**Validation Rules (Implicit from Spec)**:
- Response must be accurate and relevant, derived from the textbook (SC-002, User Story 2).
- If outside scope, indicate inability to answer (User Story 2, Acceptance Scenario 3).
