# Module 2: Computer Vision for Robotics

This module delves into the world of computer vision, exploring how we can enable robots to "see" and interpret their surroundings.

## Key Topics

-   **Introduction to Computer Vision:** Image formation, camera models, and image processing basics.
-   **Image Features and Filters:** Edge detection, corner detection, and feature descriptors.
-   **Object Detection and Recognition:** Using deep learning models (e.g., YOLO, R-CNN) to identify objects.
-   **Semantic Segmentation:** Understanding an image at the pixel level.
-   **3D Vision:** Stereoscopy, and 3D reconstruction.
-   **Visual Odometry and SLAM:** Simultaneous Localization and Mapping for robot navigation.
