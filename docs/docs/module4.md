# Module 4: Humanoid Robotics and Real-World Control

In this final module, we bring everything together to focus on the control of humanoid robots and the ethical considerations of deploying them in the real world.

## Key Topics

-   **Introduction to Humanoid Robots:** Kinematics, dynamics, and control.
-   **Bipedal Locomotion:** Walking, running, and maintaining balance.
-   **Manipulation and Grasping:** Enabling robots to interact with objects.
-   **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI):** Designing safe and intuitive interactions.
-   **Robot Operating System (ROS):** The standard for robotics software development.
-   **Ethical Considerations in Robotics:** Bias, safety, and societal impact.
-   **Final Project:** Designing and simulating a complete AI-driven humanoid robot application.
