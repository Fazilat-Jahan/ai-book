# Course Summary

The **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Program** provides a comprehensive and in-depth exploration of the technologies at the forefront of modern robotics. Over the course of 12 weeks, you will journey from the fundamental principles of AI and robotics to the advanced techniques required to build and control intelligent humanoid robots.

The program is structured into four modules:

1.  **Foundations of AI and Robotics:** Covering the basic concepts and mathematical foundations.
2.  **Computer Vision for Robotics:** Enabling robots to perceive and understand their environment.
3.  **NLP and Reinforcement Learning:** Focusing on interaction and autonomous learning.
4.  **Humanoid Robotics and Real-World Control:** Applying your knowledge to control humanoid robots and considering the ethical implications.

Through a series of hands-on projects, you will gain practical experience in developing AI-driven robotic systems. The program culminates in a final project where you will have the opportunity to design, build, and simulate your own unique humanoid robot application.

Upon completion, you will be well-equipped with the skills and knowledge to pursue a career in the exciting and rapidly growing fields of AI and robotics.
