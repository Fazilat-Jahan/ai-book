# Assessments

Your progress in this program will be evaluated through a combination of projects, quizzes, and a final comprehensive project.

## Module Projects

At the end of each module, you will work on a project that applies the concepts you've learned. These projects are designed to be hands-on and will challenge you to build real-world applications.

-   **Module 1 Project:** Building a simple AI application.
-   **Module 2 Project:** Implementing a real-time object detection system.
-   **Module 3 Project:** Training an RL agent to perform a simple task.

## Quizzes

There will be short quizzes throughout the program to help you reinforce your understanding of the key concepts. These quizzes are designed to be formative and will help you prepare for the projects.

## Final Project

The program culminates in a final project where you will design and simulate a complete AI-driven humanoid robot application. This is your opportunity to showcase all the skills you've acquired throughout the program and build a portfolio-worthy project.

The final project will be evaluated on the following criteria:

-   **Innovation and Creativity:** The novelty and ambition of your project idea.
-   **Technical Execution:** The quality and correctness of your implementation.
-   **Presentation:** Your ability to clearly communicate your project's goals, design, and results.
