# Module 3: NLP and Reinforcement Learning

This module covers two critical areas of AI for human-robot interaction and autonomous learning: Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL).

## Key Topics in NLP

-   **Introduction to NLP:** Text processing, and language models.
-   **Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis:** Understanding the meaning and emotion behind text.
-   **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifying key information in text.
-   **Speech to Text and Text to Speech:** Enabling voice-based interaction with robots.

## Key Topics in Reinforcement Learning

-   **Introduction to Reinforcement Learning:** The RL framework, agents, environments, and rewards.
-   **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs):** Formalizing the RL problem.
-   **Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQNs):** Value-based RL algorithms.
-   **Policy Gradients and Actor-Critic Methods:** Policy-based RL algorithms.
-   **Applying RL to Robotics:** Challenges and opportunities.
