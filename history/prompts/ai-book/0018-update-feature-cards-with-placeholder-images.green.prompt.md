## Prompt

/sp.implement """Below the hero section, update only the three feature cards so that each card uses a real, realistic, high-quality image related to the book “Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics” instead of abstract or generic icons. The images should visually represent real concepts such as physical robot hardware, humanoid robots, sensors, actuators, robotic arms, lab environments, or real-world robotics applications (not book icons, boxes, or abstract symbols). Keep the existing layout, grid, spacing, alignment, colors, fonts, and overall design exactly the same. Update only the card images, titles, and descriptions to match Foundations of Physical AI, Humanoid Robotics, and AI + Robotics Applications. Do not modify the hero section, navbar, footer, theme, dark mode, or any other part of the UI. """

## Response snapshot

The feature cards have been successfully updated with placeholder images.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Medium. The homepage content is significantly updated with image placeholders.
- 🧪 Tests: None.
- 📁 Files: 4 files modified (1 TSX, 3 SVGs).
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user needs to provide actual images to replace the placeholders.
- 🧠 Reflection: The task involved adapting the component to use images instead of SVGs. Placeholder SVGs were created as real image generation is not supported.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): None.
